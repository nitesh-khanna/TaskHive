# TaskHive
TaskHive is a secure, role-based task management application supporting user registration, login, and task tracking functionalities. Implemented authentication flow allowing users to sign up with name, username, email, and password, and securely log in using email/username and password credentials. Integrated a robust password reset mechanism where users can request a time-sensitive (5-minute expiry) reset link via email and securely update their password through a dedicated interface. Post-login, authenticated users are presented with a dynamic task dashboard displaying assigned tasks in a tabular format with fields like task title, description, status, and action buttons. Regular users can mark tasks as complete/incomplete, while administrative access is restricted to designated users whose credentials are seeded directly in the database. Admins have exclusive rights to add, update, or delete tasks, using dedicated form components, and can also manage task completion status. Emphasized component-based architecture, role-based access control, and secure user flows to deliver a seamless user experience.
